#Data Analysis
#Analyzing Instagram Reach,
Now let’s start with analyzing the reach of the Instagram posts.
=>	The impressions got from the home section on Instagram shows how much the posts reach the followers. Looking at the impressions from home, one can say it’s hard to reach all the followers daily.

=>	Hashtags are tools we use to categorize our posts on Instagram so that we can reach more people based on the kind of content we are creating. Looking at hashtag impressions shows that not all posts can be reached using hashtags, but many new users can be reached from hashtags. 

=>	The explore section of Instagram is the recommendation system of Instagram. It recommends posts to the users based on their preferences and interests. By looking at the impressions received from the explore section, we can say that Instagram does not recommend our posts much to the users. Some posts have received a good reach from the explore section, but it’s still very low compared to the reach received from hashtags.

=>	So, the below donut plot shows that almost 44.1 per cent of the reach is from my followers, 33.6 per cent is from hashtags, 19.2 per cent is from the explore section, and 3.05 per cent is from other sources.

#Analyzing Relationships,
Now let’s analyze relationships to find the most important factors of our Instagram reach. 
=>	The relationship between the number of likes and the number of impressions on the Instagram posts. There is a linear relationship between the number of likes and the reach got on Instagram. 

=>	the relationship between the number of comments and the number of impressions on the Instagram posts, looks like the number of comments we get on a post doesn’t affect it’s reach.

=>	More number of shares will result in a higher reach, but shares don’t affect the reach of a post as much as likes do.

=>	There is a linear relationship between the number of times post is saved and the reach of the Instagram post. 

=>	By looking at the correlation we can say that more follows and likes will help you get more reach on Instagram.


#Analyzing Conversion Rate,
In Instagram, conversation rate means how many followers you are getting from the number of profile visits from a post. The formula that you can use to calculate conversion rate is (Follows/Profile Visits) * 100. So the conversion rate of the Instagram account is 41%. The relationship between profile visits and followers gained is also linear.
